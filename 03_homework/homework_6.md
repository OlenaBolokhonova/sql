**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Reflecting on my previous role as a legal counsel at Mariupol Sea Port, I frequently encountered issues surrounding security policies and the confidentiality of personal data. My responsibilities involved ensuring compliance with security measures in contractual agreements and protecting commercial data. This experience underscored the importance of safeguarding sensitive information and adhering to ethical standards in data management.

Additionally, my personal experience as an immigrant in Canada highlighted the inequities in data collection processes. Upon arrival, my family and I faced significant challenges due to our lack of credit history, which affected our ability to rent housing. This situation illustrated how data-driven systems can inadvertently perpetuate inequities, particularly for newcomers or individuals without established credit histories. The rigidity of traditional credit scoring methods failed to consider our unique circumstances, leading to unjust outcomes.

In the context of data science, these experiences emphasize the need to incorporate ethics and address inequities. Credit scoring systems, as an example, have far-reaching impacts on individuals' financial opportunities. Traditional automated credit scoring tools, as discussed in a Yale Journal of Law and Technology article, raise concerns about accuracy and fairness. The advent of big data and alternative credit scoring methods aims to benefit underserved consumers by leveraging diverse data points to detect behavioral patterns. However, this approach introduces ethical concerns, including transparency and the potential for biased or inaccurate scoring.

The principle of "all data is credit data" can result in individuals being scored based on a wide array of data points from their online and offline activities. This lack of transparency and understanding about how these scores are calculated can lead to unfair credit assessments. Furthermore, inaccuracies in the data can significantly hinder individuals' financial progress and opportunities.

To address these issues, it is crucial to develop ethical guidelines and practices in data science that ensure transparency, fairness, and accuracy. My legal background and personal experiences have instilled in me a strong commitment to advocating for these principles. In my future roles in data science, I aim to leverage my expertise to promote ethical data practices and work towards systems that recognize and mitigate inequities. By integrating my legal knowledge with data science, I hope to contribute to creating fairer and more transparent data-driven decision-making processes.
